Had a webex with Customer

Found a MS SQL job which was in Hung state for 3 days

use the CHROME debug gui got the JOB id and usign the below curl commands marked it as completed

curl -XGET localhost:14300/index_activity/_doc/28622aaf-2928-49cb-83d6-8f452aa439ea?pretty > /home/admin/28622aaf-2928-49cb-83d6-8f452aa439ea.log      ##  This command will save the existing Elastic Search entry for the index_activity.  Always perform this step if modifying the ES database.

curl -XPOST localhost:14300/index_activity/_doc/ab390968-0e75-4e27-abba-904cb4592991/_update -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"doc":{"state":"COMPLETED"}}'   ## This command is going to change the state from Running to Completed, which will remove it from the UI.


Customer wanted to run a manual job for the policy and it completed successfully.
